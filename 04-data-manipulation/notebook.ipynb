hired as a data analyst for a local soccer team. The team has recently signed on some junior players and wants to give them as much experience as possible without losing games. If the head coach could be confident in the outcome of a game by halftime, they would be more likely to give the junior players time on the field.\n\nThe coach has asked you whether you can predict the outcome of a game by the results at halftime and how confident you would be in the prediction. \n\nYou will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.","metadata":{},"id":"5a0a52d9","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.12","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
